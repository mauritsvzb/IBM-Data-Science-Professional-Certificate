## üìÑ Summary
This capstone project will ultimately predict if the Space X Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

The full report can be found here.

### Context and Business Understanding
* SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rockets at a cost of around $62m. This is considerably cheaper than other providers (which usually cost upwards of $165m), and much of the savings are because SpaceX can land, and then re-use the first stage of the rocket.

* If we can make predictions on whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch, and use this information to assess whether or not an alternate company should bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

# üìë Main Topics
This project follows these steps:

1. [Data Collection](https://github.com/mauritsvzb/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/tree/main/10.%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/1.%20Data%20Collection)
   * Making GET requests to the SpaceX REST API
   * Web Scraping
2. [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/mauritsvzb/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/tree/main/10.%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/2.%20Data%20Wrangling)
    * Using the `.fillna()` method to remove NaN values
    * Using the `.value_counts()` method to determine the following:
      * Number of launches on each site
      * Number and occurrence of each orbit
      * Number and occurrence of mission outcome per orbit type
    * Creating a landing outcome label that shows the following:
      * 0 when the booster did not land successfully
      * 1 when the booster did land successfully
3. [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/mauritsvzb/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/tree/main/10.%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/3.%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis)
    * Using SQL queries to manipulate and evaluate the SpaceX dataset
    * Using Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize relationships between variables, and determine patterns
4. [Interactive Visual Analytics](https://github.com/mauritsvzb/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/tree/main/10.%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/4.%20Interactive%20Visual%20Analytics)
    * Geospatial analytics using Folium
    * Creating an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash
5. [Predictive Analysis (Classification)](https://github.com/mauritsvzb/IBM-Data-Science-Professional-Certificate/tree/main/10.%20Applied%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/5.%20Predictive%20Analysis%20(Classification))
    * Using Scikit-Learn to:
      * Pre-process (standardize) the data
      * Split the data into training and testing data using train_test_split
      * Train different classification models
      * Find hyperparameters using GridSearchCV
    * Plotting confusion matrices for each classification model
    * Assessing the accuracy of each classification model

## üîë Key Skills Learned/Used
* Using data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem
* Using data analysis and data visualisation to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it
* Interactive dashboard development with Plotly Dash
* Interactive map development using Folium
* Using machine learning to build a predictive model to help a business function more efficiently
* Structuring and building a data-findings report
